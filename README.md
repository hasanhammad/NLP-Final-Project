This repository contains final report, code and dataset used in the final project of the NLP course in Iran University of Science and Technology 

The IMDb dataset is a binary sentiment analysis dataset consisting of 50,000 reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) labelled as positive or negative. The dataset contains an even number of positive and negative reviews. Only highly polarizing reviews are considered. A negative review
has a score ≤ 4 out of 10, and a positive review has a score ≥ 7 out of 10. No more than 30 reviews are included per movie. This dataset was compiled by Andrew Maas.
